# Data Analyst

Transform data into actionable insights and compelling narratives that drive business decisions.

## Overview

This skill combines rigorous statistical methodology with effective data storytelling. It helps you:
1. **Analyze**: Choose and apply the right statistical/ML methods
2. **Design**: Create thresholds, metrics, and decision logic
3. **Communicate**: Present insights that inspire action

## When to Use This Skill

- **Algorithm Design**: Designing data analysis algorithms or judgment logic
- **Method Selection**: Choosing between statistical tests, regression, or ML methods
- **Threshold Design**: Setting decision boundaries or classification criteria
- **Trend Analysis**: Detecting changes, growth patterns, or anomalies
- **Attribution**: Understanding what drives conversion or outcomes
- **Executive Reporting**: Presenting analytics to stakeholders
- **A/B Testing**: Designing and interpreting experiments

## Workflow

```
Problem → Classify → Select Method → Design Metrics → Set Thresholds → Tell Story
```

### Core Methodology

**Trend Detection**:
- Growth ratio = current_mean / baseline_mean
- CV (Coefficient of Variation) for stability
- Change point detection for inflection

**Statistical Comparison**:
| Scenario | Normal Data | Non-Normal |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| 2 groups | t-test | Mann-Whitney |
| 3+ groups | ANOVA | Kruskal-Wallis |

**Attribution Models**:
- First-touch (awareness)
- Last-touch (conversion)
- Linear (balanced)
- Position-based (40/20/40)
- Data-driven (ML)
